So far I have asked other people if they are interested in my project and have found some potential developers to help me. I do not know how to create iOS applications yet so the initial time investment is learning the process of getting a simple application interface running. My friend has created some image mockups for app views such as the login. I will be putting more time into discussing with him the specifics of where to start in the development stage. Given that I have a Mac I will be in charge of the development but my friend can research API's and leverage web interfaces to assist me, as well as provide constructive feedback via pair programming.
